## 🎭 FIN6 Adversary Emulation

**FIN6** is a financially motivated threat group that has been active since at least **2015**.  
They are known for their **high-impact intrusions** into **retail, hospitality, and e-commerce** organizations, with the goal of **stealing payment card data** and later evolving to **ransomware operations**.

### 🔑 Key Characteristics
- 🏪 Initial focus on **Point-of-Sale (PoS) intrusions**  
- 💳 Exfiltration of **payment card data** for underground resale  
- 💻 Shift towards **ransomware deployment** (Ryuk, LockerGoga) for financial gain  
- 🛠️ Use of **living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins)**, credential theft, and lateral movement  

### 🧩 TTP Coverage
- **Initial Access** → Office macros, phishing, and stolen credentials  
- **Active Directory** → PowerShell, WMI, and Windows Script Host  
- **Exfiltration** → Compressed data over FTP channels  


### 🎯 Purpose of Emulation
This project **recreates FIN6’s attack flow** in a controlled lab environment for:  
- 📖 Learning adversary behaviors (mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK**)  
- 🛡️ Validating defensive controls & detections  
- 🧪 Practicing **end-to-end red team operations**
